# OpenAI HTTP API Client

A strongly-typed client for the OpenAI HTTP API.

This crate is an *unofficial*, community-driven effort.

## Example

```rust
let openai = Client::new(&api_token);

let prompt = "Some popular programming languages are ";

let req = CreateCompletionRequest::new(prompt).model("text-davinci-003");
let resp = openai.send(req).await?;

let text = resp.choices[0].text.clone();

println!("{prompt}{text}");
```

Or run some of the examples:

```sh
. env.sh
cargo r --example chat
cargo r --example completion
```

## Status

The software is under active development and the API is expected to change.
